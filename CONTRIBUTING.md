### **Adding Labels to Commit Messages**

To maintain a clean and organized commit history, we use **labels** in commit messages. Labels help categorize changes and make it easier to understand the purpose of each commit at a glance.

---

### **Why Use Labels?**
- **Clarity**: Labels provide context about the type of change being made.
- **Searchability**: They make it easier to filter and search through commit history.
- **Consistency**: They ensure all contributors follow the same conventions.

---

### **How to Add Labels**
1. **Format**:
    - Start your commit message with a label in square brackets, followed by a short description of the change.
    - Example: `[feat] Add user authentication`.

2. **Scope (Optional)**:
    - If the change is specific to a part of the codebase, include a scope after the label.
    - Example: `[fix][auth] Resolve login issue`.

3. **Description**:
    - Write a clear and concise description of the change.
    - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add" instead of "Added" or "Adds").

4. **Body (Optional)**:
    - Provide additional context or details about the change in the body of the commit message.

5. **Footer (Optional)**:
    - Reference related issues or pull requests (e.g., `Closes #123`).

### **Best Practices**
1. **Be Consistent**:
    - Use the same labels and formatting across all commits.
2. **Keep It Short**:
    - Write concise commit messages (50â€“72 characters for the subject line).
3. **Use Imperative Mood**:
    - Write commit messages as if youâ€™re giving a command (e.g., "Add" instead of "Added").
4. **Reference Issues**:
    - Use the footer to link commits to related issues or pull requests.

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your changes.
2. Make your changes and commit them using the label format.
3. Push your changes to your forked repository.
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
